# June 2th: Research, planning, beginning the schematic. 

Today I began by doing research on what I would need for the development board what model of the STM 32 I would use.

I decided on the STM32F103C8T6. 

After reading alot of documentation, I complied everything that i'd need for my development board:

Voltage regulator
10uf Capacitor
10k resistor 
Push button for reset
SWD Header 
LED + 330ohm resistor 

I placed everything on Ki-Cad and started making my traces.
